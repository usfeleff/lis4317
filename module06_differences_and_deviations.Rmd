```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```


```{R, ""}
myMTCars <- mtcars
# mt cars has the carnames stored as the rownames, which is annoying
# so we will "extract" them to a proper column, ggplot will be happier this
# way anyway
myMTCars$carName <- rownames(myMTCars)

# get average mpg and decide if each car is better or worse so that we can
# easily color things in a moment
avgMpg <- mean(myMTCars$mpg)
myMTCars$mpgCompare <- ifelse(myMTCars$mpg < avgMpg, "below avg", "above avg")

# I want a plot that shows the difference for each car from the average, so
# calculate that and sort the frame
myMTCars$mpgDiff <- myMTCars$mpg - avgMpg
myMTCars <- myMTCars[order(myMTCars$mpgDiff),]

# ggplot and the sort don't seem to want to work, hence the reorder
ggplot(myMTCars, aes(x=reorder(carName,mpgDiff), y=mpgDiff)) +
  # generate the geometry layer (plot)
  geom_bar(stat='identity',aes(fill = mpgCompare)) +
  # set some pleasing colors, I am partial to Ethan Schoonover's solarized
  # palette
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("below avg" = "#d33682", "above avg" = "#6c71c4")) +
  # rotate our x labels so they can actually be read, and remove the title
  # above the legend with the silly way ggplot makes you do it, then add titles
  # and axis labels
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle =90), legend.title=element_blank()) +
  labs(title="Car Mileage", subtitle=paste("difference from ",round(avgMpg,1),"mpg average") , x="", y="+/- Avg. MPG")
